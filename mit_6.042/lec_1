What is a proof

Experimentation and observation

sampling and counter examples

judge, jury

word of god

"I dont see why not" -> transferes responsibility to disprove to the others


A mathematical proof is a verification of a proposition by a chain of logical deductions from a set of axioms.

def: A proposition is a statement that is either true or false

Ex. For all N in the set of natural numbers, n^2 + n + 4 is a prime number
    quantifier       natural numbers         Above is a predicate whos truth depents on the value of a variable

n     n**2 + n + 4     prime
0     41               true
1     43               true
2     47               true
3     53               true  
40    1681             false
41                     false



Ex. a**4 + b**4 + c**4 = d**4 has no positive integer solutions

a = 95800
b = 217, 519
c = 414,560
d = 422,481

there exist a,b,c,d in natural numbers, a**4+b**4+c**4=d**4

Ex: 3/3(x**3) ....
Solution is over 1000 digits long

Ex:The regions in any map can be colored in 4 colors so that adjacent regions have different colors

(four color theorem)

Many false proofs of four color theorem

proofs by picture are very convincing and often very wrong

ex. every even integer but 2 is the sum of two primes.

Golbach's conjecture, nobody knows if it is true.

-----------------------------------------------
proof

for all n in z, n >= Z -> N**2 >= 4

def: An implication p=> q is true if p is false or g is true

Truthe Table
------------
p | q | p -> q
T | T | T
T | F | F
F | T | T
F | F | T

pigsFly -> i'm king is true by implication

Ex> For all integers in Z, n >= 2 <==> ( if and only if) n**2 >= 4

F. n = -3

def: Axioms are propositions that we assume are true ( greek for "assume worthy")

Ex: if a = b and b = c then a = c ( no proof, however its an axiom)

Axioms can be contradictory in certain contexts

Euclidean geometry: Given a line L and a point P not on L, there is exactly one line through P parallel to L
Spherical geometry: Given a line L and a point P not on L, there is NO line on through P parallel to L
Hyperbolic geometry:                                     , there are infinitely many lines through P parallel to L

Two guiding principles to axioms:

Axioms should be
1. consistent
2. complete

def: a set of axioms is consistent if no proposition can be proved to be both true and false
def: a set of axioms is complete if it can be used to prove every proposition is either true or false
